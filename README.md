# BestShop_Project

This is a responsive one-page website built as part of a frontend development workshop. The project is based on an Adobe XD design and represents a fictional company that offers online store management services and dedicated software tools.

The main goal was to practice translating a static design into clean and well-structured HTML and CSS. The site is fully responsive, with a layout that adapts smoothly across various screen sizes. It was a great opportunity to solidify the basics of modern web layout and styling.
